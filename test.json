I've used the \"intitle\" search operator for some time, but not many people seemed to have noticed the changes. It might be worth pinpointing when the changes was made, and also notifying the people elsewhere on this talk page and in other places who are in uproar about the categorisation system. Those who have any experience with the categorisation system (I did for a few years about five years ago) are probably a bit shocked at how many people don't really follow how it works at all, and the amount of misunderstanding going on around this. </p>"
